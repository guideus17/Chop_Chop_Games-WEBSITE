            <h2>Clockwork Heroes has launched!</h2>
            <p>Hey itch.io people
                We are proud to finally present the full Clockwork Heroes experience here on itch.io!
                We wanna thank all our followers who have given us great feedback and followed our progress.
                We had a rough launch as we discovered a major, and very nasty, bug right on the time of release,
                so sorry you had to wait a few extra hours. Your can continue from your save progress from the demo,
                and if you want to start anew then just select level 1 from level select, or bind the restart speedrun
                button in settings.
            </p>

        <div id="devlogwrapper">
            <h2>Clockwork Heroes v0.2</h2>
            <p>Changes to current stuff - Cursor art updated and made much more smooth and in-line with the other game
                graphics
                Changes to almost all the levels with improvements and feedback given from people.
                Some parts made a bit harder, some parts made a lot easier (mainly level 7 made much more smooth)!
                Fixes to fonts, now all fonts in the game represent the system
                Signs in level 1 changed and made much more understandable
                Changes to UI art
            </p>

            <h2>What's Next? Showcase and theory of new cards, elements and effects!</h2>
            <p>A lot of people have been asking us, when will there be more effects? Well, instead of just saying, how
                about we show you what went into the next effects, the design process behind them and show a bit
                of the gameplay from the new mechanics introduced in them?
                Remember though, these new effects are still subject to big changes in terms of the visuals
                (and perhaps minor in terms of gameplay), which is why they aren't released yet. So dont look too
                closely at the art, and more at the gameplay part of it. </p>

            <h2>Putting your darling on ITCH - thoughts and advice</h2>
            <p>We recently decided that ITCH.IO would be our go-to place for publishing our demo (and hopefully in the
                end) our game.
                I wanted to just give a little insight into our process of coming to that decision, what we've learned
                so far, what
                we could have done better and what we will do in the future. We were familiar with ITCH through the few
                gamejams we've
                been to, but never thought much about it in terms of self-publishing our game. That was until we started
                to read more from
                Indie-devs in similar situations and were inspired by platformers such as Celeste, which managed
                to grow quite a large ITCH following and actually get some good engagement from the hardcore indie
                community.</p>
            <div class="devider"></div>
        </div>





        <div id="devlogwrapper">
            <h2>Struggles, Launch & Competition</h2>
            <p>We really underestimated how much time and effort it took, to actually market your game while developing
                simultaneously. We uploaded our first demo to ITCH about 10 months ago and actually got pretty good
                feedback.
                With thousands of downloads, lots of community engagement and generally good feedback on our devlogs, we
                wanted
                to keep it going. However all those things took away from the development and design of the game. Even
                if the
                hours used on ITCH & Marketing weren't that many, just changing the way you think and what mode you're
                in
                (posting & developing) can drastically affect the work you get done.
